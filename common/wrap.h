/**

 * @brief Thin wrappers for common functions.
 * 
 * A non-comprehensive set of thin wrapper functions to provide consistent error management. These wrappers are intended
 * for use within cz* API implementations rather than for general use.
 * 
 * @note Due to differences in error reporting between various platforms and standards (e.g. MacOS, Windows, POSIX), as
 * well as differences in error categorisation compared to this API (@c CzResult enumeration values), the documented
 * return values for wrappers are @b not guarantees. If an error occurs in a wrapper function, the wrapper provides no
 * guarantee the corresponding error value will be returned. And in particular, if the platform does not provide any
 * reliable method to identify the type of error that occurred, @c CZ_RESULT_INTERNAL_ERROR will commonly be returned.
